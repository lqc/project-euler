;; Solution to Project Euler problem 27
;; http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=27
;;
;; Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:
;;
;; n^2 + n + 41
;;
;; It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the
;; consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40,
;; 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly
;; when n = 41, 41Â² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
;;
;; Using computers, the incredible formula n^2 + 79n + 1601 was
;; discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values
;; n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 126479.
;;
;; Considering quadratics of the form:
;;
;; n^2 + a * n + b, where |a|  1000 and |b|  1000
;; where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n, e.g. |11| = 11 and |4| = 4
;;
;; Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic
;; expression that produces the maximum number of primes for
;; consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
